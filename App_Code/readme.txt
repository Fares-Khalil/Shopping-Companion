Shopping Companion is an all-in-one application that simplifies groceries by allowing users to search for the cheapest versions of products across many grocers. Once the user has decided which products to purchase, they will be able to create multiple shopping lists for different grocery shops. The backend of the program is built in Java, and the user interface using JavaFX. MySQL was also used to handle certain functions of the program that required storage and interaction with a particular user's prior activity on the application.
